Topic Modeling and Medical Charge Prediction: Project Overview
This project is focused on two key objectives:

1. Topic Modeling
The goal of this part of the project is to extract meaningful insights from unstructured medical notes. By applying topic modeling techniques, we aim to identify hidden themes or topics within the textual data. These insights can help:

Understand common concerns in medical notes.
Group similar documents together for further analysis.
Highlight key patterns in patient complaints and diagnoses.
Key Steps:

Preprocessing the text data (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization).
Applying TF-IDF vectorization to represent the data numerically.
Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover latent topics.
2. Predicting Healthcare Charges
The second part of this project focuses on predicting healthcare charges based on patient and procedural data. By using machine learning techniques, we aim to build a predictive model that can estimate healthcare costs based on various factors.

Key Objectives:

Understand the factors contributing to healthcare charges (e.g., demographics, diagnoses, treatments).
Build an accurate model to predict charges for future patients.
Provide actionable insights for healthcare providers to optimize costs.
Key Steps:

Data cleaning and preprocessing of patient and procedural data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify relationships and trends.
Feature engineering to extract relevant variables.
Model building using regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
Model evaluation to ensure accuracy and reliability of predictions.
Deliverables:
A set of extracted topics from medical notes, along with visualizations.
A predictive model for healthcare charges, including evaluation metrics and feature importance analysis.
This project combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) for unstructured data analysis and machine learning for predictive modeling, providing a comprehensive approach to tackling challenges in healthcare data analytics.
